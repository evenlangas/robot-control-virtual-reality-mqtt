# Robot Remote Control in Virtual Reality Using MQTT

This Unity project enables the remote control of a robot in virtual reality (VR) using the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. It provides a seamless interface for controlling robot movement, manipulating robotic arms or appendages, and receiving sensor data back from the physical robot.

Features

VR Robot Control: Intuitive control of a virtual robot representation within a Unity-based VR environment.
MQTT Communication: Leverages MQTT, a lightweight messaging protocol ideal for IoT devices and robotics, to transmit commands and potentially receive data.
Customizable Robot Model: Easily replace the default robot model with your own robot design.
Sensor Integration: Integration of sensor data from the physical robot back into the VR environment.
